	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p>This page contains glTF models and their USDZ counterparts. As conversion and USDZ rendering are still very much application dependant, multiple conversions of the same glTF file are provided.</p>
	<p>Currently, conversions are done with the needle-tools/three.js fork r154.1 and Blender 3.6.</p>

	<h2>Why</h2>
	<p>
		File interoperability is hard. It's getting easier though â€“ modern formats like glTF and USD bring great features and capabilities to the table.  
		Currently, the 3D world is split: glTF is often used for realtime pipelines, while USD is often used for film productions. However, these worlds start to merge; and so do the capabilities of these formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, it becomes more important that there are good test files, both for these formats as well as for conversions between them.
	</p>
	<p>
		This page is targeted at implementers, developers, and designers working with these file formats.
		A clear goal is to allow you to download files for a specific usecase and check if your target viewer/platform supports what you want it to support.
